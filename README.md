WGemCombiner
========

Script to combine gems automatically - Written in Visual C#.


### Get WGemCombiner

Head to the [Release page](https://github.com/gemforce-team/wGemCombiner/releases) to download the last version of the program.  
At the moment we only have a working Windows version.


### How To

You give a gem recipe (or use one of the preset ones), put base gems on the correct starting slots
and the program sends mouse/keyboard events to the system to perform it in game automatically.  
There is an extensive help inside the program.
